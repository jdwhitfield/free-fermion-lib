Free Fermion Distance Measures Module

This module contains core distance measure functions for analyzing quantum states
in the context of free fermion systems and stabilizer formalism. These measures
quantify various notions of distance from classical or free-fermion behavior.

Key functionality:
 - Stabilizer distribution and Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE)
 - General Rényi entropy and linear entropy measures
 - Fermionic covariance distribution analysis
 - Fermionic Anti-Flatness (FAF) distance measure

The distance measures implemented here are fundamental tools for characterizing
quantum states and their proximity to classical, stabilizer, or free-fermion
subspaces in quantum many-body systems.

def stabilizer_distribution(rho):
    """
    Compute the probability distribution over Pauli operators in the stabilizer representation.
    
    This function calculates the stabilizer distribution ξ_P for a quantum state ρ,
    where each element represents the probability of finding a specific Pauli operator P
    in the representation of the state. The distribution is defined as:
    
    .. math::

    where :math:`\\langle P \\rangle_\\rho = \\text{Tr}[\\rho P]` is the expectation value of 
    Pauli operator P in state ρ, :math:`d = 2^n` is the dimension of the Hilbert space 
    for n qubits, and :math:`Purity(\\rho) = \\text{Tr}(\\rho^2)` is the purity of the state.
    
    The stabilizer distribution is a fundamental quantity in stabilizer formalism
    and quantum error correction, providing insight into how "classical" or 
    "stabilizer-like" a quantum state is.
    
    Args:
        rho (numpy.ndarray): Input quantum state. Can be:

            The function automatically detects and converts wavefunctions to density matrices.
            
    Returns:
        numpy.ndarray: Stabilizer distribution ξ of length 4^n, where each element
                      ξ_j corresponds to the probability associated with the j-th

                      normalized such that Σ_j ξ_j = 1.
                      
    Raises:

def SRE(rho, a=2):

    Compute the Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE) of a quantum state.
    
    The Stabilizer Rényi Entropy is a measure of how far a quantum state is from

    and :math:`d = 2^n` is the dimension of the Hilbert space.
    
    For stabilizer states, SRE = 0, while for maximally mixed states or
    Haar-random states, SRE approaches its maximum value. This makes SRE
